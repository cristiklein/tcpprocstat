tcpprocstat is used similarly to the `time' command, but returns the number of
bytes an application has sent and received using the TCP protocol.

tcpprocstat uses libtcpprocstat which it LD_PRELOADs to intercept the read(),
write(), recv(), send() calls. The number of bytes successfully received
/ sent (i.e. the return value of the above functions) is added to global
counters. Only file descriptors which have been created using
socket() of type SOCK_STREAM are taken into considerations. libtcpprocstat
ignores bytes received with MSG_PEEK.

All the limitation typical to LD_PRELOADed stuff applies. For example,
you cannot tcpprocstat a static executable or a setuid executable.
